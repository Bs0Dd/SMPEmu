Genjitsu SMP Protocol Extension version 0.2:

	This protocol extension defines the following commands for the MK90 SMP bus.
	Within this extension's command pool, which is 0xF0 ~ 0xFF, the lower 4 bits are, unlike the original manufacturers' specs, NOT "don't care".

	Commands are as follows:

		Command 0xF0 — list files in card
		Returns:
			Array of file names, not more than [8].[3]; null-terminated strings of 4~12 bytes (terminator excluded). 
			The array is finalized with 0xFF. 

		Command 0xF1 - select file to emulate
		Does:
			If the file exists, mounts it as the emulated storage.
			If the file doesn't exist, creates a 10KB file, then mounts it.
		Accepts:
			Null-terminated file name, not more than [8].[3].
		Returns:
			nothing
			don't even try
			just why
			no

		Command 0xF2 — optional, stop emulation (reserved in case I find a way to replace BASIC commands)
		Does:
			Unmount the mounted image, flushing the remaining buffer into the storage.
		Accepts:
			nothing
		Returns:
			also nothing
